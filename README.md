# <h1 align="center"> Catapulta.sh Monad Template</h1>
Template repository for getting started quickly with [Catapulta.sh](https://catapulta.sh/docs) smart contracts development platform for Foundry projects in Monad L1.


## Getting Started - Dev Container
Get onboarded faster using Docker with a developer environment ready to build and deploy Solidity smart contracts:
- Click here to open a Solidity environment in Cursor:
  - [![Dev Container - Cursor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Container&logo=docker&message=Open%20in%20Cursor&color=black&style=for-the-badge)](https://tinyurl.com/2d96r6fd)  


- Click here to open a Solidity environment in VSCode:
  - [![Dev Container - Vscode](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Container&message=Open%20in%20VSCode&color=blue&logo=docker&style=for-the-badge)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/catapulta-sh/catapulta-monad-template)



Once your IDE loads the Dev Container, proceed to [Deploy your first contract with Catapulta](#deploy-your-first-contract-with-catapulta) section.


## Getting Started - Git

Requirements

- [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
- [Node.js](https://gist.github.com/d2s/372b5943bce17b964a79)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

Click "Use this template" on [GitHub](https://github.com/catapulta-sh/catapulta-monad-template) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

You can also git clone this repository and enter to the repository directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/catapulta-sh/catapulta-monad-template
cd catapulta-monad-template
```

## Deploy your first contract with Catapulta

1. Install forge dependencies

```
forge install
```

2. Install catapulta via `npm`

```
npm i -g catapulta
```

3. Generate a new private key with Catapulta, is stored offline in your .env, or add your own as `PRIVATE_KEY` in the .env file stored at the root of the project

```
catapulta wallet

# Output:
# Wallet address: 0x6B193d5604e09f1737E33cFc4B06fb3f2C7fC3CE
```
4. Setup your `CATAPULTA_API_KEY` into your .env, generate one free key at [Catapulta](https://catapulta.sh/auth)
5. Deploy the basic contract into Monad testnet with Catapulta, using `--sponsor` flag to **request gas in autopilot**. This skips the need of faucets.

```
catapulta script script/Deploy.s.sol --network monadTestnet --sponsor
```

```
# Output:
Catapulta.sh 🏏 Forge script deployment (0.4.1)
